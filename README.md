    "In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation System 🚗📲🎟️\n",
    "📁 Capstone Project | Team TWARB\n",
    "🧠 Overview\n",
    "This project presents an In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation System, designed to provide passengers with the most relevant promotional offers while traveling. The aim is to improve customer engagement and drive business conversions by suggesting targeted coupons based on contextual and demographic data.\n",
    "👥 Team Members\n",
    "•\tAustin Kanja\n",
    "•\tBenson Ouma\n",
    "•\tRahab Gachie\n",
    "•\tTed Ronoh\n",
    "•\tWinnie Odoyo\n",
    "🔍 Business Understanding\n",
    "In today's dynamic marketing ecosystem, targeting customers with context-aware promotional offers can significantly enhance engagement. The system we're developing uses machine learning to recommend coupons based on:\n",
    "•\tCustomer demographics\n",
    "•\tTrip context (weather, time of day, direction)\n",
    "•\tHistorical behavioral patterns\n",
    "By aligning promotions with real-time customer contexts, this solution aims to increase coupon acceptance and ROI for marketers.\n",
    "❓ Problem Statement\n",
    "Despite frequent use of coupons in the food and beverage industry, businesses often suffer from low acceptance rates due to poor personalization. Our challenge:\n",
    "Build a machine learning system that predicts the likelihood of a customer accepting a given coupon based on available features — thereby enabling more targeted and effective coupon delivery.\n",
    "📊 Dataset Description\n",
    "•\tSource: UCI Machine Learning Repository / [Kaggle-based repository]\n",

    "•\tFeatures: 26 (both categorical and numerical)\n",
    "Some key features:\n",
    "•\tdestination, passanger, weather, time, coupon, gender, age, occupation, income, Bar, Coffeehouse, etc.\n",
    "•\tTarget Variable: coupon (0, 1, 2) representing types of coupons accepted\n",
    "⚙️ Technologies Used\n",
    "•\tPython 3.10+\n",
    "•\tPandas, NumPy\n",
    "•\tMatplotlib, Seaborn\n",
    "•\tScikit-learn\n",
    "•\tJupyter Notebook\n",
